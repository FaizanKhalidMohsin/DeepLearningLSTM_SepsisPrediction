The rationale behind this is that different measurements/features have different temporal resolutions. 
Some measurements are taken every hour (e.g. Heart Rate) and some measurements are taken every 10 hours

Method: 
	0. Get the mean time interval taken between measurements of each feature, and round up.
	1. Forward fill existing values to replace missing values for a certain amount of time (that mean time interval)
		Any missing values past that time interval will remain NA
	2. MinMaxScaling of all numeric values between 0 and 1
	3. Assign any remaining missing values to -1
